    <h2>Concepts I used to do this assignment</h2>
  <p>
For this assignment, I used the GitHub concepts we learned. These concepts helped me manage my project and work efficiently. The main concepts I used are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Repository:</strong> A repository is a place where my project files are stored on GitHub.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloning:</strong> Cloning allows me to copy the repository from GitHub to my local computer.</li>
  <li><strong>Branching:</strong> Creating a branch helps me work on changes without affecting the main project.</li>
  <li><strong>Committing:</strong> A commit saves the changes I make with a message explaining what was done.</li>
  <li><strong>Pushing:</strong> Pushing uploads my local changes to the GitHub repository.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> GitHub makes it easy to collaborate by sharing code and tracking changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts helped me successfully complete and manage this assignment using GitHub.</p>
